What is the Raspberry pi? 
Raspberry Pi is a SBC device the size of a credit card, developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, whose purpose is to teach computers to young children. We can say that it is a circuit board that contains things such as RAM GPIO pins on a single card.
Raspberry Pi Models

As we mentioned at the beginning, Raspberry Pi is a credit card sized mini computer, but since 2012, it has introduced many models with more up-to-date hardware features for different usage areas. Let's examine these models together.

Raspberry Pi Pico H (2023)
It has the same features as Raspberry Pi Pico, but it has soldered headers and a debug connector. Raspberry Pi Pico H is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller board with flexible digital interfaces. It features the RP2040, marking Raspberry Pi's first microcontroller designed in-house. Reprogramming Pico's flash memory can be done using USB or via the Serial Wire Debug (SWD) port.

Raspberry Pi Pico W (2022)
Raspberry Pi Pico W is the WI-FI supporting version of the normal pico model. Raspberry Pi Pico W 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g WiFi v providing soft access point supporting up to four clients

Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (2019)
Raspberry Pi 4, released in 2019, made a splash with its powerful processor and RAM options. Raspberry Pi 4, which has a Broadcom BCM2711 processor, has a 4-core ARM architecture Cortex-A72. Raspberry Pi 4, whose processor (CPU) operating frequency is 1.5 GHz, is approximately 10% faster than the previous model, Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+. The Pi 4, which has LPDDR4 RAM, has 3 different RAM options: 2GB, 4GB and 8GB, unlike the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, it also has 2 USB 3.0 and 2 USB 2.0 ports. Raspberry Pi 4, which has a Gigabit Ethernet port, offers users high speed in terms of connection with 5.0 GHz Wireless connection and Bluetooth 5.0 technology. Additionally, Pi 4 has 2 micro HDMI ports that support 4K 60 fps. GPIO pins are exactly the same as older models, so you can use your compatible modules with Raspberry Pi 4.


Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ (2018)
It is the latest version of Raspberry Pi released on Pi Day 2018 (March 14). Physically, the size and placement of the card remained the same, following the B+/2/3 order, but its processor and wired/wireless network connection speed were updated. Thanks to the gigabit Ethernet controller on Pi 3B+, it is 3 times faster than before and supports PoE (Power-over-Ethernet) supported wired; Thanks to dual band 802.11ac wireless connection, 2 times faster connection support is offered in wireless connection. Additionally, Bluetooth support has been upgraded from Bluetooth BLE 4.1 to BLE 4.2 provided in Pi 3. If you want to get detailed information, we recommend you to read our Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ Review article on our blog.

Raspberry Pi Model 3 (2016)
The biggest difference of this model, which is the continuation of Raspberry Pi 2, is that it has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection. Additionally, its 4-core processor with ARMv8 64-bit architecture operates at 1.2GHz frequency and has 1GB RAM memory.

Raspberry Pi Zero / W (2015/2017)
It is the Raspberry Pi model that shook the whole world in 2015 :). The biggest reason for this is that it was offered for sale with a price tag of $5. It is the smallest sized Raspberry Pi model. Its hardware (processor and memory) is exactly the same as Raspberry Pi Model B. Due to its size, it has a micro USB-OTG port instead of a full-size USB. In 2017, the Rasberry Pi Zero W model with wireless connection was launched.

Raspberry Pi 2 (2015)
It is one of the most powerful models of Raspberry Pi at the time. Although it has the same card layout as Model B+, this card has a 4-core processor with ARMv7 architecture and 1GB RAM memory. There is not much price difference between Model B+ and them. It has become a less preferred model as it is no longer up to date.
